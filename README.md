# SlideFlow

A simple presentation rehearsal tool for tracking slide timing and reviewing what you say while presenting.

## Overview

SlideFlow lets you upload a presentation PDF, practice your delivery, and review basic timing and speech data. It records how long you spend on each slide and generates slide-by-slide transcripts so you can reflect and improve.

## Features

- **Per-Slide Timing**: Automatically tracks time spent on each slide to help balance pacing
- **Speech Transcription**: Uses Google Cloud Speech-to-Text to transcribe your voice accurately, even for longer recordings
- **Slide-Aware Transcripts**: Transcripts are segmented by slide number for easy review
- **Export Options**: Download transcripts as `.txt` or `.md` files
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Audio files are automatically deleted after transcription to ensure privacy
